ABSTRACT:

In this project we have analyzed 333 samples of primary tumor in prostate adenocarcinoma, 
publicly accessible thanks to the consortium The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). 
We have selected omics data of these tumors in different platforms: mRNA, CNV, RPPA, Methylation, miRNA and molecular subtype among others.
We have discovered, analyzed and validated our clustering exercise and we have found 4 subgroups of patients 
based on the expression of 338 lncRNA genes. The contingency analysis of our cluster c2 showed correlation of 
samples with other groups based on different omics groups described by the TCGA consortium in the magazine 
Cell in 2015 in its article "The molecular taxonomy of primary prostate cancer". Interestingly, we found S
POP mutated enriched in our cluster2 as well as extremely confidence correlation with mRNA cluster, methylation 
cluster and molecular subtype. We have also analyzed our dataset with dimensionality reduction techniques, suitable 
when the number of variables greatly exceeds the number of observations. This Principal Components Analysis (PCA) 
allows us to capture the genes with greater specific weight to discriminate the groups of patients and could be the 
starting point of future investigations with these genes.
